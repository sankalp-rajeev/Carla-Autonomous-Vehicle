"""
Improved Inference Script for Trained PPO Model in CARLA Environment with Lane Detection

- Shows a single window with the lane detection overlay.
- Implements smooth logging and environment reset on episode end.
- Uses a try-finally block to guarantee proper cleanup.
- Reduces penalties for minor lane invasions via a modified lane_data handler.

Make sure the CARLA simulator is running before executing this script.
Ensure the Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection project (and its configs) is in your PYTHONPATH.
